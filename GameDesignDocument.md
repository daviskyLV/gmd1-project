### Interactivity
- The player mainly moves around the world with camera via joystick
- They have available actions in hotbar that they can choose by pressing a button

The player oversees the entire world, but can interact only with the world environment close to their believers. 
### Monetization
- Base game price
- Additional later developed content as DLCs
### Platforms
Game is intended mainly for PC use, but since it has limited input set it can be easily adapted for mobile and console use as well.

## Milestones
1. Implement world generation and place down civilizations
2. Implement some world manipulation as a god, have other civilization gods also do random (for now) things, make civilization people always fight between each other
3. Implement more complex AI logic for both other gods, as well as civilizations. Polish up UI and other fixes.
